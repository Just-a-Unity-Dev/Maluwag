# Rules

Basic rules. Follow them.

## Rule 1. No touching outside the `<body>` tag
Simply put, `<body>` is where you can access. Nothing else.

## Rule 2. You can only modify /img and /index.html
Explanatory.

## Rule 3. Keep things legal
Yeah. I dont want a DMCA or a lawsuit over a funny github repo.

## Blocked elements
List of tags you cannot use
- <style> *psst. you can still use the style TAG. just not the element. because it screws up the page*
- <script>
